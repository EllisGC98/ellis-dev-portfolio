                                I'm Ellis, a Computer Science graduate from Ulster University, specializing in Front-End React development. I have a genuine passion for crafting smooth and immersive user experiences that seamlessly merge technology with creativity.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Currently engaged in production support within the financial sector, I dedicate my spare time to front-end development. Notably, I've successfully built and sold out my own NFT project, showcasing my deep interest in the web3 space.
                            </p>

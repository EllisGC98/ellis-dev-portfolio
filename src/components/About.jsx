                            Hello there! I'm Ellis, a Computer Science graduate from Ulster University, specializing in Front-End React development. I have a genuine passion for crafting smooth and immersive user experiences that seamlessly merge technology with creativity.

                            <br></br> Currently engaged in production support within the financial sector, I dedicate my spare time to front-end development. Notably, I've successfully built and sold out my own NFT project, showcasing my deep interest in the web3 space.

                            <br></br>Outside the coding arena, I'm a freedom seeker and avid traveler, always on the lookout for new experiences to fuel my creative spark.
